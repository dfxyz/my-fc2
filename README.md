# DF_XYZ's Far Cry 2
I like ArmA, but it's too hardcore to enjoy it as a game. So I always want to make other FPS more realistic instead.

Far Cry 2 is a great FPS. It has many exaggerated but really interesting elements like weapon jamming, healing animations, finishing off injured enemies with machete and etc. In my opinion, it's far better than the later ones.

Some unrealistic elements are real fun and acceptable for me. But some I cannot bear with:
* weapon damages
    * PKM uses 7.62x54mmR but it's damage is pathetic
    * both G3KA4 and FAL use 7.62x51mm NATO, but their damages are not equal
* weapon accuracy
    * it's ridiculous for pistols to have better accuracy than rifles
* engage distance
    * too short for military FPS players' taste

I want to fix those problems and I do not care about the "balance".

Recently I played [Far Cry 2: Realism+Redux](https://www.moddb.com/mods/far-cry-2-realismredux). It's good and I enjoyed it. Also, I found out that Boggalog, author of [Realism+](https://www.moddb.com/mods/far-cry-2-realism-toms-mod), provided [An Almost Complete Guide to Far Cry 2 Modding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozhN9s_4puzSXVYs12ZAOayyL036hgQuFCVS_jSXbd0). So I decided to make my own one based on `Realism+Redux`.
