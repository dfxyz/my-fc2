    <string enum="5103351" value="I heard about Ms. Davar… Very unsettling. She had no living family, I believe. Perhaps it is for the best. There will be no one to mourn her." />
    <string enum="5107235" value="And as long as we’re on the subject – I hope you’re not being too reckless with Xianyong. He’s smart and has a lot of talent. But he needs to survive if it’s going to be developed…" />

    <string enum="5108168" value="Your latest assignments sound like they ended well. Bilders is quite effective -- for such an eccentric. I’ve heard some intriguing stories about that man." />
    <string enum="5103473" value="By the way, I’ve learned a lot about our late friend, Xianyong. He had a remarkably rich career for someone so young. All of it illicit. Wasted potential now." />

    <string enum="5105007" value="It’s been difficult, these last few days. I heard about Frank Bilders. That man was on a collision course. But no one deserved what happened to him. Such a shame." />
    <string enum="5109828" value="One more thing. You have my admiration, sir. I know how you came to the aid of Mr. Hyppolite in that recent business. He is alive today because of you." />
    <string enum="5104558" value="So, the rumor is you kept Nasreen Davar alive and in one piece after her latest fiasco! Of course you’ll never get her to admit to it. She is prideful to a fault." />

    <string enum="5107962" value="I was just thinking about Nasreen Davar. I lost my sister years ago. Sometimes I would give anything just to know that she was not alone and frightened. It’s good that Nasreen knew you, and fought beside you when she did." />
    <string enum="5106299" value="Let me just say… What happened to Mr. Hyppolite was a tragedy. For a man to survive the things he’s lived through, and then meet his end here of all places… Well, anyway." />
    <string enum="5105073" value="You know, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about Flora. I’ve seen many people die here. Many women. But she kept her chin up, somehow. I’m glad she was not alone when she finally fell." />
    <string enum="5109323" value="I haven’t said anything about Ferenc… I hope you know how sorry I am. He always acted like he was too good for this life, but deep down I think he knew he was born to it. I’m glad you were there during that fight." />
    <string enum="5109089" value="Quarbani’s death… I want you to know how sorry I am. He was a colleague. Probably the most professional man I’ve ever met. You know he respected you..." />
    <string enum="5106453" value="So Ferenc made it! It’s so ridiculous. He dragged you into one of his half-baked schemes, and then almost got his head blown off for his troubles. Good thing for him you’re one of the reliable ones." />
    <string enum="5108434" value="It sounds like you and Quarbani Singh had a near-miss! You need to be careful, cher. Men like him are strong leaders, but they sometimes motivate the people around them a little too well…" />
    <string enum="5109679" value="I can’t tell you how sorry I am -- about Warren. For all his eccentric behavior, he was an asset. A loyal ally. I guess there’s some consolation in knowing that he went out fighting." />
    <string enum="5104955" value="I was sorry to hear about Paul… I liked him. In spite of everything that’s happened here, I really expected him to be one of the survivors. It’s such a shame." />
    <string enum="5107890" value="Singh is gone. It’s just terrible. He seemed so impervious. I couldn’t imagine the force required to knock the man down, let alone end his life. I hope his family will be okay." />
    <string enum="5107224" value="And besides, cher -- I am still breathing thanks to you! You held up your end of the bargain last time. The least I can do is return the favor…" />

    <string enum="5103640" value="Yeah, so I heard. Alencar was a big pal of yours, I understand. That last job sounded like it turned into a pile of crap in a hurry. What could you do?" />

    <string enum="5009927" value="You know, you’ve been acting like a complete cowboy… That latest stunt with Marty Alencar. You’re both lucky you made it out in one piece. He won’t say it, but he’s grateful to you." />

    <string enum="5104665" value="Anyhow. It’s a bloody shame Marty won’t be around to join in the festivities. Seems like his kind of mayhem." />
    <string enum="5106026" value="Well bloody done on that last gig, mate. Xianyong’s still trying to figure out how he walked away with all his limbs attached." />
    <string enum="5108274" value="Shit man – I figure the world’s gone to hell when a lady like Michele Dachss has to die in the muck. Screw it." />

    <string enum="5105643" value="While I got ya here -- I’m sorry about what happened to your buddy Ferenc." />
    <string enum="5109836" value="So you managed to keep Paul Ferenc in one piece during his last ill-conceived bullshit job. Good for you, dude." />

    <string enum="5105832" value="Anyway, I’m just takin’ a little break from all the big action. That last job was intense. Thanks to you, I’m still breathing to plan the next one." />
    <string enum="5107524" value="Hey – There’s no figuring why a guy like Josip finally gets his ticket punched in this shit-hole. You held up your end, man. It was outta your hands." />
    <string enum="5109058" value="Nice work, by the way. I’m starting to see why Singh likes working with you. You cover your corner when it really counts." />
    <string enum="5106187" value="So. Quarbani, huh? That really sucks." />
    <string enum="5107468" value="I just learned about Alencar. It sounds like there was nothing you could do. I’m sorry." />
    <string enum="5108502" value="You got my complete faith, bro. Paul Ferenc relied on you and you came through. Good enough for me." />
    <string enum="5107419" value="Yeah, well… (clucks) Our luck’s got to change at some point. After Flora, you know… We’re due, man." />
    <string enum="5106244" value="Hey, good job on the Warren Clyde exfil… You saved that guy’s bacon proper. That earns you serious points around here." />
    <string enum="5107712" value="Just gonna come out and say this – I’m not gonna second-guess you, just because of what happened to Quarbani. He was a professional, and he knew the risks." />
    <string enum="5106728" value="Now’s not the time to be sitting around idle. After Paul and everything. I don’t want to obsess about it. At least he took some of those cocksuckers with him." />
    <string enum="5105841" value="One more thing… A goddamned shame about Hyppolite. I would’ve said that guy was basically bulletproof, you know?" />
    <string enum="5106826" value="By the way… I’m sorry about Josip. I know he was a buddy of yours. You were there, huh? That’s what I heard. That you tried to save him." />
    <string enum="5103309" value="Anyway, this is just a dry-run. I’ve got a couple big schemes brewing. I can’t let Quarbani Singh steal my thunder. Bad for my rep." />
    <string enum="5104538" value="Maybe it’s not my place to say, but I’m glad to see you’re still at it. Losing Singh was a bad hit. But you’ve got to send a message to these viado shit-bags." />
    <string enum="5107906" value="Oh. Hey. Full props to you, going in after Xianyong Bai like you did. Might not be much consolation, but you did as much as anyone could have. Sorry man." />
    <string enum="5106053" value="Just gonna come out and say this – I’m not gonna second-guess you, just because of what happened to Hakim. He was a professional, and he knew the risks." />
    <string enum="5104533" value="You’re a lucky sonofabitch. I got the full ‘after-action’ on that last gig of yours. Sounds like Nasreen Davar almost got both your asses shot up." />
    <string enum="5104748" value="Oh, so thanks to you, I get to listen to Josip recount his latest exploits endlessly… Next time, try to save somebody who’s not such a loudmouth." />
    <string enum="5108400" value="Yeah, well… (clucks) Our luck’s got to change at some point. After Nasreen, you know… We’re due, man." />
    <string enum="5106073" value="Hey, I just wanted to say – I’m sorry about Michele Dachss. She might have been out of her depth, but what she tried to do here… That was brave. I respect that." />
    <string enum="5103024" value="Way I see it, now’s not the time to be sitting around idle. After Frank and everything. You think about that shit and you start to go screwy. At least he went out swinging." />
    <string enum="5108153" value="Aren’t too many ways this can go wrong. I’m just shadowing from a respectful distance. It’s not like you’re using me for bait – That’s Michele’s whole deal." />

    <string enum="5009711" value="Crazy thing about Nasreen. I don’t just mean her dying. You ever do any background on her? No wonder she never talked politics. Regardless, she was a warrior." />

    <string enum="4889740" value="I've got nothing left. I wish I could help. There is one place...A man I know at Mt. Thabamolaetsa -- near the base. It's a mile northeast of Pala. You'll see on your map." />
    <string enum="4889710" value="This is not your day. I have nothing here. But I can help.  Go see a friend of mine. A veterinarian northwest of Pala. You'll find him on your map." />
    <string enum="5105622" value="Don’t get me wrong – I just don’t feel like moping around Mike’s while they auction off Idromeno’s stuff. I’m sad about him too, but shit… Que saco." />
    <string enum="5108813" value="Are you nuts?!" />
    <string enum="5107811" value="Maybe it’s not my place to say, but I’m glad to see you’re still at it. Losing Echebbi was a bad hit. But you’ve got to send a message to these viado shit-bags." />
    <string enum="5103162" value="Anyway, somebody upstairs must like you… You and Andre Hyppolite walked out of that last shit-storm in once piece. This ought to be a piece of cake." />

    <string enum="5107322" value="Are you insane?" />
    <string enum="5109688" value="Are you insane?!" />
    <string enum="5108478" value="Okay, I admit it -- I'm pretty down about Mr. Bilders. You know he was helping me with my English? Yeah, with my vocabulary. No one else would do that. Now he's just dead." />
    <string enum="5103574" value="Hey, you're an okay guy -- You fought off a whole army so that Frank could get away, right? As long as you do that for me, I got no worries." />
    <string enum="5104528" value="Huh. So, how long did you know Marty for? I saw him around a few times, always seemed like a badass merc motherfucker. It's too bad about him. He told good jokes." />
    <string enum="5106265" value="You know, no offense -- But you and that Alencar guy are big goddamn troublemakers. He so lucky you didn't get blown to pieces your last job! He owe you big time, huh?" />
    <string enum="5106568" value="I don't even WANT to know about your last job--! I can't even guess what you and that Hakim were getting up to. But I guess it's a good thing there were two of you, or it could have been real bad." />
    <string enum="5105991" value="Hey, this is like a holiday for me, man! After our last big shoot-out? Yeah, I take a nice relaxing break and just follow you around for a while." />
    <string enum="5108032" value="You and me have to pull off a big caper one of these days... I hear about you and Andre. Man you guys crazy." />
    <string enum="5103052" value="Hey look man -- I am very sorry about Andre. He was a good guy. Sometimes I was a little scared of him. But he end up being some hero, huh?" />
    <string enum="5107067" value="Well, anyway -- I'm sorry about your friend. Marty Alencar. When he got killed, I heard you were trying to help him. Was he American? I heard him speak some other language once." />
    <string enum="5105972" value="Of course, it doesn’t hurt that you and Marty Alencar managed to walk out of that last situation relatively unscathed. I feel you’re a dependable asset." />
    <string enum="5107333" value="There are some extravagant stories circulating – involving you and Hyppolite against a company of militia. You’re both breathing, so they must be true." />
    <string enum="5105316" value="I don’t know if you’d heard, but Bilders was reported dead. You knew… It sounds like an ugly situation." />
    <string enum="5104879" value="Not that I want you to get overconfident, but… It didn’t escape my attention that you managed to keep me alive on our last project." />
    <string enum="5106375" value="I just heard that Hyppolite is dead. What a terrible waste." />
    <string enum="5109819" value="Sad news about Xianyong Bai. I didn’t get a chance to work with him, but what I heard was – well, anyway. I’m sorry you had to bear the burden of that." />
    <string enum="5009371" value="You were friends with Hakim Echebbi? I’m sorry for your loss. I guess former Naval commandos don’t often get to choose the circumstances of their deaths. It’s better for him that you were there." />

    <string enum="5109391" value="How well did you know Hakim Echebbi? He was a player, underneath that family-man façade. Quite ruthless, actually. I’m sorry we lost him." />
    <string enum="5108290" value="Okay, I say something: I'm very sorry that Nasreen got killed. Extra bad to have to see that. So I'm extra sorry for you. I hear you tried to save her." />
    <string enum="5009764" value="Here’s the thing. Dude like Xianyong goes pretty far on balls and luck. That’s how it goes. You don’t smarten up quick, and the luck gets used up. Poor bastard." />
    <string enum="5103004" value="Here’s the thing. Guy like Warren gets pretty far on pure balls and luck. That’s how it goes. You don’t smarten up quick, and the luck gets used up. Poor bastard." />
    <string enum="5009634" value="By the way… I’m real sorry about Andre. I know he was a friend of yours and all. I heard you did what you could for him." />
    <string enum="5109386" value="To be honest – I’m just hoping we run across those bastards that took Michele Dachss. They crossed a line, man. I want to see them pay for it." />

    <string enum="5104402" value="Anyway, this is just a dry-run. I’ve got a couple big schemes brewing. I can’t let that showoff Echebbi steal my thunder. It’s bad for my rep." />
    <string enum="5009293" value="Besides, last time we jumped into the deep end it worked out just fine. Of course I don’t need another close call like that for a while, but still…" />
    <string enum="5105786" value="Sad about Mr. Echebbi. He didn't talk to me a lot. Not sure if he had a problem with me, or whatever. But he once showed me picture of his old house. In the Emirates, right? Man, he must have been pretty rich once upon a time." />
    <string enum="5108148" value="Hey. Maybe you think I'm worried about helping you? Well I'm not. Not because of Frank, honest. He was a tough guy, but he told me that sometimes tough not enough. I know you tried to help him." />
    <string enum="5105433" value="Oh, yeah -- I ought to say something before. About Mr. Hyppolite. Hard to believe he gone now. Hard to believe." />
    <string enum="5105366" value="Hey, you're nuts working with that Nasreen. She's a crazywoman. You know she was ambushing Taliban before anyone in America even HEARD of them? I heard she once stole a taxi in Kandahar and drove it all the way to Tehran." />
    <string enum="5104015" value="So, anyway -- I guess it's gotta be tough with Mr. Echebbi getting killed, huh? I bet he was glad you were there when it happened. Better than to be all alone." />
    <string enum="5108306" value="Looking forward to busting some heads. Get some payback for that whole clusterfuck with Bilders. Shit, man. I’m gonna miss that guy." />
    <string enum="5103675" value="Man, too bad we don’t got a forty here. To pour out for Guillen. I may not have shared her politics, but she was solid. A warrior." />
    <string enum="5106518" value="It's real messed-up -- That lady, Nasreen. I hear some stories about her. Running from Soviet army when she a little girl. She do all that, then gets killed here." />
    <string enum="5107251" value="You got my complete faith, bro. Frank relied on you and you came through. That’s all I need to know right there." />
    <string enum="5109418" value="Well, I wanted to say I’m sorry about your buddy Warren Clyde. Loyal comrade, right? I could see that. It was a good thing that you were around when you were. You did the right thing." />

    <string enum="5105540" value="I’m sorry." />
    <string enum="5103424" value="Fuck you -" />
    <string enum="5103510" value="A deal’s a deal. And he’s not part of it. He’s got to go." />
    <string enum="5009551" value="You’re wasting time. Just shoot him." />
    <string enum="5103874" value="We made our deal. He’s not a part of it." />
    <string enum="5109461" value="Stay lower. There is a sniper out there." />
    <string enum="5106907" value="So, Paul Ferenc… Finally got himself into a mess he couldn’t lie, cheat or steal his way out of. You were a good soldier to have stuck by him the way you did." />
    <string enum="5107148" value="This isn’t going to be another “Marty Alencar” situation. I don’t mean to speak badly of the dead. But he let things get out of control. I grew up around boys like him." />
    <string enum="5109790" value="I hear you were with Quarbani Singh, at the end. I’m sorry. It was a big loss. For all of us." />
    <string enum="5108590" value="I heard you managed to keep Paul Ferenc alive, last time out. You’re wasting your time. This man is a magnet for trouble." />
    <string enum="5104201" value="Singh speaks very highly of you. Well, not in so many words, maybe. But he made it clear that you do all right under pressure." />
    <string enum="5103630" value="It really was a shame about Warren. He and I weren’t exactly friendly – But he had guts and maybe even some raw talent. I guess I don’t need to tell you." />
    <string enum="5107347" value="I heard Ferenc bought it on your last job. This place chews people up and spits them out. You blink, and they’re gone. I’ve seen it happen a hundred times." />
    <string enum="5104139" value="You know it’s hard to believe that Mr. Singh is gone. He was top-notch. One of the few true professionals in this place. Hard to believe..." />
    <string enum="5103695" value="And – I probably already said this – but thanks again. You kept your wits about you in a bad situation." />
    <string enum="5109475" value="Before you go… I wanted to say I’m sorry about Hakim. I didn’t know him very well. He was a professional." />
    <string enum="5103531" value="How well did you know Nasreen? I know she was brave. However it happened, I know she went out fighting." />
    <string enum="5104853" value="And… I heard about Bilders. I know he was a friend of yours. Sorry man." />
    <string enum="5105063" value="Before you go… Xianyong was my friend too. I’m glad you were by his side at the end. In our profession, sometimes that’s all you can hope for." />
    <string enum="5108605" value="I hear these jobs of yours have a way of turning into escapades. Maybe last time wasn’t your fault. That Alencar is an adrenaline junkie. Cute, but not so smart." />
    <string enum="5009233" value="A shame about Warren Clyde. The big poser never did know when to keep his head down. It’s dumb luck that he made it as long as he did." />
    <string enum="5106468" value="Hey, if Warren Clyde can survive your latest train-wreck of an assignment, you’re obviously doing something right. I feel safe and secure already." />
    <string enum="5104613" value="Now, what was that dangerous nonsense with Michele Dachss? Another decadent thrill-seeker. Likes hanging around big, dangerous men. You watch that one." />
    <string enum="5105376" value="Hey… I’m really sorry about Michele. I don’t know her whole story. She seemed like an idealist. I know you did everything you could. No one holds you responsible." />
    <string enum="5106538" value="And look – Don’t start second-guessing yourself because of Alencar. You guys were solid. You can’t plan every contingency. Sometimes it’s just bad luck." />
    <string enum="5107692" value="So what kind of secret monkey-business did you and Ferenc get up to this last time? All I know is you got a lot of pissed off militia after your asses. And you managed to keep Ferenc from getting chopped into compost." />
    <string enum="5105233" value="Yeah. I hear about Flora Guillen. It’s a terrible shame. Terrible." />
    <string enum="5105780" value="Hey big shot. The story is – you and Guillen wiped out whole platoon of militia guys. This is not too shabby." />
    <string enum="5105013" value="You know, a lotta people looked up to Quarbani. You worked with the guy, yeah? He had some history, that guy. Not all of it perfectly clean, you know? But that was a guy you wanted to fight beside." />
    <string enum="5009467" value="Paul Ferenc – He was a friend of yours? I heard you were in on that last job. I also heard you tried to help the guy. I’m sorry, man." />
    <string enum="5103014" value="Man… I’m gonna miss that Singh guy. Real tough customer. Total pro. Shame the way he bought it." />
    <string enum="5103489" value="You pull some big fucking funny business on militia lately. You and Echebbi. You really mess things up good. Heh." />
    <string enum="5105192" value="Is true about Marty? Goddamn. Makes me sad to think. He was a good guy. Good guy to have drink with. Good guy to stir up shit with." />
    <string enum="5009337" value="You got a reason to celebrate, eh little man? You pull off big tactical upset, last caper. You and Singh are deadly combination. I like to watch masters at work." />
    <string enum="5106723" value="Just one thing. I was never happy about that Dachss woman running around here. Amateurs are dangerous. In the end, it cost her life. I’m sorry to have to say it." />
    <string enum="5108405" value="I’ll tell you something. I heard about comrade Idromeno. A damned shame. He should have been bouncing grandchildren on his knee – not playing soldier." />
    <string enum="5105878" value="You, I don’t worry so much about. You’re not the kind to take stupid risks. Not like that mafioso – Idromeno. (spits) All these former Warsaw Pact tough-guys. They all act like American cowboys now." />
    <string enum="5103192" value="Don’t worry about me. I understand the risks we take. You know what else? Josip did too. He’d sen it all. He may have been a gangster, but knew how it could end." />
    <string enum="5106048" value="One more thing. Good job. You helped out Alencar pretty good this time round, hey? Really stuck it to those dumb militia fuckers." />
    <string enum="5103125" value="Jesus. Goddamn Warren Clyde. What the hell is guy like that ever thinking? So many risks, all the time. Even with someone like you trying to look out for him. He didn’t stand a chance." />
    <string enum="5108473" value="So how about you? Starting to really raise some hell, yeah? Well, you got the right guy helping you out with that. Warren Clyde. Heh. You backed him up real good on that last job." />
    <string enum="5108091" value="Hey, you take good care of Michele – in the middle of some crazy scheme. You’re okay." />
    <string enum="5109366" value="Okay, so look. I want to say I’m sorry. Michele was friend of yours. She was a tough one to keep up with. I know you did your best to look after her. Not your fault." />
    <string enum="5104676" value="Well come on then..." />
    <string enum="5107655" value="Look at you. I heard about the radio tower gig. You feel like doing some REAL harm?" />
    <string enum="5104920" value="That antenna's good for more than just music. I'll tell you that much. Water company's hired local guns for security. Big pipeline project. They use militia radio for their 9-1-1 calls. Like if say a big bomb went off at their construction site. You follow me?" />
    <string enum="5103925" value="Suffice to say, it would be a great personal favor if you turned him into a grease-stain. Give me the perfect chance to go repossess some of the merchandise he seized. Of course his boys will be none too happy to see me, so I might need your help in that department." />
    <string enum="5103463" value="Yeah? Well who needs you?" />
    <string enum="5105744" value="I thought you might like that. Hit the pipe with an explosive. The security boss will run down to the radio station faster than a loose shite going through a tall Swede. If you knock out the tower while he’s there? Two birds with one stone." />
    <string enum="5108691" value="Matter of fact, I DO have a grievance with the man. He used to be a garden-variety hoodlum until he got all full of himself and decided to play rent-a-cop. He shut down my business. I'll spare you the details." />
    <string enum="5109489" value="They have at least one technical truck." />
    <string enum="5106951" value="Watch those wounded; some of them can still pull a trigger." />
    <string enum="5107381" value="Never mind then... There's no shame in being small-time." />
    <string enum="5107488" value="My friend. I was very sorry to hear about Marty Alencar. But at least you were there." />
    <string enum="5109343" value="Listen. The business with Frank Bilders... Truly a shame. I don’t know what else to say." />
    <string enum="5109533" value="Listen. I knew Xianyong. The Chinese kid. Not well, but I was sad to hear how it went down for him. He deserved better than this place." />
    <string enum="5008970" value="And hey – I know how you stood with Echebbi during that latest misadventure of his. I admire that." />
    <string enum="5106222" value="Okay yeah -- I heard what you did for Marty… But I’d help you anyway. You seem like an all right guy." />
    <string enum="5108346" value="Hey. The Davar woman told me about how you ran in and saved the day... I never knew you were so gallant." />
    <string enum="5105887" value="Listen. What happened to Mr. Echebbi, that… Well it’s a terrible thing." />
    <string enum="5109523" value="Anyway, it’s the very least I can do. You came through for me on that last job. Not everyone would have." />
    <string enum="5109750" value="About Nasreen. You did everything you could, I hope you know that. Her story was never going to have a happy ending." />
    <string enum="5109108" value="Jesus – I heard the big boom all the way over here. The chief's on his way to the radio tower. I suggest you hasten to meet him." />
    <string enum="5108316" value="Bloody maniac... Word's getting around about what you did. I’m gonna go try to collect my goods, but I’ll need you to back me up." />
    <string enum="5103278" value="Brilliant. You know the pipeline I mean, right? One big bomb ought to do it." />
    <string enum="5109760" value="It's Frank at the Safe House. We should have a little chat concerning your latest assignment." />
    <string enum="5109661" value="CHRIST... Uh, things've gone bad... I need your help, man... HURRY…!" />
    <string enum="5109557" value="And another thing! I want to thank you for watching out for Xianyong during that latest thing… He’s just a kid. Invincible. Lucky." />
    <string enum="5009223" value="And by the way… I heard what you did for Frank out there. You’re a good man." />
    <string enum="5107313" value="What was it about the plan that you found so difficult to stick to, exactly...? Go on then. I’ll see ya around." />
    <string enum="5108823" value="You know – I was thinking about what happened to Marty… I hope it was quick for him. I really do." />
    <string enum="5128760" value="Woman! Why are you sneaking around out there?" />
    <string enum="4896858" value="Stay back or you’re dead!! All of you!!" />
    <string enum="5121177" value="Hey. Got your intel. Looks good. Can you see a bricked-up building there? Supposedly UFLL’s got a hostage in there. Foreign-national, like you. You’re to get in there and free ‘em. Wrap up your survey and take care of it." />
    <string enum="5122124" value="Good job. Maybe I was a little quick to judge you. Tell you what -- Anybody that does good work for me gets paid fair and square. Come on back down to the arena and we’ll settle up." />
    <string enum="5128024" value="Ah... Hey. Hey! What's going on out there? (a beat, then to self) Where did I put it...?" />
    <string enum="4896777" value="You go to hell! -- All of you!!" />
    <string enum="4976858" value="So now what?" />
    <string enum="5128833" value="OK! It’s done. - I see you later. OK?" />
    <string enum="5123494" value="Hey. Got your intel. Not bad. You see a bricked-up building down there? We think APR’s got a hostage in there. Some foreigner, like you. Get in there and bust them out. Finish up your recon if you think it'll help." />
    <string enum="5123416" value="Oh… very good. Who know you turn out to be competent after all? Fair enough. Guys that do good work get paid. Come on back up to the slaughterhouse and I'll make good on that." />
    <string enum="5123400" value="Hey, muy bien. You did better than expected. Look, maybe I was hasty in my evaluation of you. Guys that do good work for me get paid. Come on back up to the fishing pier and I'll cash you out." />
    <string enum="5121717" value="Okay errand-boy. I need you to scout out APR position south of you – Big place used for chicken-fights. You know? I want you to perform reconnaissance. There's observation point marked on map. Go there now." />

    <string enum="5122842" value="Howdy. Got your intel. Looks solid. You got eyes on a bricked-up building? The Front’s got a hostage in there. Foreign-national, apparently. You’re to get in there and break ‘im out. Wrap up your survey and get it done." />
    <string enum="5128517" value="Hey son. You did all right. Maybe I should be offering you a full-time gig. Anybody that does good work for me gets proper payment. Come on back down to the camp." />
    <string enum="4896696" value="Come on man! -- Get some! -- All I need is one shot! One shot!" />
    <string enum="4896485" value="Remember, God is watching you." />

    <string enum="4580865" value="I’m standing right here." />
    <string enum="4580925" value="Find the brother and take the ledger!" />
    <string enum="4933114" value="This book you take, it will scare the captain. Very badly. He will not waste time driving around. He will go straight to his police post and hide." />
    <string enum="4580546" value="Then, he is no longer a moving target. Easier to kill." />
    <string enum="4580637" value="So what is in this book that is so important. Simple. It is a list of all the bribes the captain takes from APR. For many years. Dangerous book." />
    <string enum="4580642" value="The deputy chief, he likes other side. When he finds out what captain has done, he will hand all over police weapons to UFLL to - even the playing field." />

    <string enum="4933194" value="You should take it." />
    <string enum="4933238" value="The chief will freak out when he hears you have the ledger. He’ll cut his tour short and go straight back to his office. Try to hide." />

    <string enum="4933434" value="When you do this, the constable will become very frightened. He will cancel his Sunday drive and return to his police station." />
    <string enum="4886387" value="He will be an enclosed space there. Much easier to terminate." />
    <string enum="4887311" value="So. You’re going to assassinate the police chief?" />

    <string enum="4887265" value="Find the brother and make him give you the book!" />

    <string enum="4887594" value="I am this foreign man’s driver. So I will surely be in a bad spot when the attacks begin. - I hope I can count on your assistance." />
    <string enum="4933894" value="Please, hear me out." />
    <string enum="4887115" value="He’ll send out the guns on a convoy. Then I will ambush them and take the weapons." />

    <string enum="4933494" value="Personally, I intend to eliminate those weapons. Every last one of them." />
    <string enum="4886547" value="I’ll ambush the convoy on the road. - You are welcome to join me." />
    <string enum="4933462" value="He is right to be frightened. That ledger lists all the bribes he has taken over the years. From the APR." />
    <string enum="4933466" value="Now the deputy chief, he is another story. He disagrees with his superior about everything. When he learns about these bribes, he’ll hand over the entire armory to the UFLL. Simply out of spite." />
    <string enum="4887814" value="Once the minister’s dead, the DJ can read a special announcement on the air." />
    <string enum="4887818" value="I mean, you have to convince him to do it, of course." />
    <string enum="4887750" value="You’re going to blow up Liberation Radio? Good idea. But I have a favor to ask you first." />
    <string enum="4887758" value="The Propaganda Minister lives at the resort. He’s listening to the radio with one hand on the kill switch, to stop the broadcast if he doesn’t like what he hears. - Could you take care of him for me?" />

    <string enum="4886854" value="You should take it. It would make your job very easy." />
    <string enum="4886927" value="Because once the chief realizes you have this book, this ledger, he will change his plans. He’ll cancel his trip and drive straight to the gendarme’s station." />
    <string enum="4886932" value="He thinks he will be safe there." />
    <string enum="4886936" value="Then he is no longer a moving target, you see. Easier to kill." />

    <string enum="4934190" value="A little bird tells me you’re off to destroy Liberation Radio." />
    <string enum="4934194" value="So it goes. But first, I suggest you head over the hill." />
    <string enum="4934198" value="In that resort you'll find the so-called Propaganda Minister. The wee cunt who puts the 10-second delay on the broadcast. Do us a favor and put a bullet in his skull." />
    <string enum="4932530" value="Of course, I really don't want to have to try to pull that off all on my own... I can get in there while they're distracted, but getting back out is gonna take some suppressing fire. You willing to do that?" />
    <string enum="4934158" value="Hey, friend." />
    <string enum="4934326" value="Problem is, I’m this crooked fucker's driver." />
    <string enum="4888294" value="Reckon it puts me in harm’s way, but there’s naught to be done." />
    <string enum="4888298" value="I could use your help, though, when the time comes." />
    <string enum="4934286" value="The United Front’s meddling in my big score. Way I see it, it’s time to knock them down to size." />
    <string enum="4934290" value="They’re looking to make nice with the we-are-the-worlders. So they’ve flown in some bent health official, to visit the clinics." />
    <string enum="4934294" value="That public-service announcement is a load of bollocks. But it’s sure to get the locals after our visitor. Get him nice and killed." />
    <string enum="4934246" value="Then, after you’ve made your big entrance at the radio station, have a word with the DJ." />
    <string enum="4888162" value="And convince him it’s in his best interest to read a message on the air. All official like." />

    <string enum="4932382" value="Thing is, we have a chance to do a lot more damage up front to these guys. They've kept the location of their medical stores a secret a long time. This guy you're going to kill has that information on him." />

    <string enum="4933006" value="You know why he’ll freak out?" />
    <string enum="4933010" value="Because that book is a ledger. It lists all the bribes he’s taken from the APR over the years. - What kind of moron writes that down? And keeps it?" />
    <string enum="4933014" value="Here’s the point. The deputy hates his boss’ guts. When he finds out about these bribes, he’ll be so pissed he’ll hand all the police weapons over to the UFLL, just to get back at the chief!" />
    <string enum="4580206" value="Find the and take the book! Then we’re in business!" />

    <string enum="4934202" value="Today’s the day. Take another step towards financial independence." />
    <string enum="4934206" value="So you’re off to kill Yabek. The tosser deserves it. Stabbed me in the back, didn't he?" />
    <string enum="4934210" value="Used to work together. Salvaged crash sites for ordnance. Found this old Soviet HIND wreck. Chock fulla good shite. Wanna take a go?" />

    <string enum="4584301" value="I’m going to tell you something. You’re not going to believe it, but it’s true. I have over thirty million dollars sitting in a numbered account in Lucerne. And I can’t touch a penny of it while I’m in this godforsaken country." />
    <string enum="4934082" value="My family will die in Lagos if I can’t get them out in time." />

    <string enum="4888502" value="Man I’m hungry." />
    <string enum="4888506" value="Hey guess what. I have bomb. HUGE bomb. Biggest one you’ve ever seen." />
    <string enum="4934410" value="But I need fuse. You know? You get for me? It's at old crash site. Russian gunship." />
    <string enum="4888558" value="Because you know, this man you have to kill. Yabek. He is hiding on boat under bridge." />
    <string enum="4888562" value="We blow up bridge." />
    <string enum="4888566" value="We smash Yabek." />
    <string enum="4890944" value="We have given each other life. I promise to make our lives worthy of the gift." />
    <string enum="4934330" value="This bridge, it’s substantial in size." />
    <string enum="4934334" value="APR troops are likely to notice it falling down. - Make sure you’re up for a fight." />
    <string enum="4932458" value="And once he’s got the ring... all that gold sitting there? He'll let The Front &quot;look after&quot; it." />
    <string enum="4932462" value="You know I did some bodyguard work for this guy. He’s definitely good for it." />

    <string enum="4888358" value="And now favoring us with his backside!" />
    <string enum="4934354" value="The detonator is at the crash site! - Near the gunship!" />

    <string enum="4580024" value="Their commander. He’s this Gurkha. Guy refused to give me a job. Can you believe that? He said I couldn’t cut it." />
    <string enum="4580029" value="He’s about to find OUT what I can cut." />
    <string enum="4580033" value="His guys will probably try to stop me. I could use some backup." />
    <string enum="4933018" value="Nah, man! I’m just playing with you! I just need the soldiers to move out so that I can get ‘em in a better position. I’m gonna blow the train tracks about two miles up. Whoever survives will get off the train, and THEN -" />

    <string enum="4933126" value="They deploy, at first sign of trouble - and YOU are first sign of trouble for them -  when they go, I put hole in tracks. Not so good for their train." />
    <string enum="4933130" value="Then, if everyone on train not dead, I'll take a look around. Find this Gurkha guy, and finish him off at close range. Do the job right." />
    <string enum="4580555" value="He is not Gurkha. He is little man. Bean-counter." />
    <string enum="4933118" value="There is whole platoon of soldiers, already on train, ready to go, and he holds them back! Says they cannot go." />

    <string enum="4932830" value="I won’t be able to get out of there on my own. I’ll be surrounded. I need you to rendezvous and give me cover." />

    <string enum="4579833" value="But once he’s dead, the units will definitely deploy. Especially after you blow those gas cars." />

    <string enum="4936925" value="OK. The soldiers are in range. I think they have found the contraband. - Merde. If the APR finds out I’ve wagered their goods, I’ll be in trouble. I’ll need your help if things go badly." />

    <string enum="4933066" value="What?" />
    <string enum="4921493" value="Fine. Let me give you piece of advice. Rough diamonds -- only currency worth shit around here. Don't take paper money from nobody. I wouldn't use it for toilet paper. You do work for the UFLL -- you get paid in stones." />
    <string enum="4921502" value="So okay... One of my guys - not so smart – delivers case of diamonds here yesterday. Dumbfuck sticks case somewhere in the camp and then gets shot in the face back in town. Maybe *you* killed him. Anyway, if you go outside and find the diamonds, they’re all yours.

    <string enum="4932798" value="Hate to lay traps, but I have no choice. They’re here to get me." />
    <string enum="4932802" value="Look. I stole medical supplies. OK? And I sold them on the black market." />
    <string enum="4932806" value="What else was I supposed to do? The factions keep all the medicine for themselves. I tried to strike a deal with the APR." />

    <string enum="4921600" value="Now... One of my men - not one of the bright ones - picked up a case of diamonds and dropped 'em off here yesterday.

    <string enum="4581417" value="Me, you know. I’m the guy they’re looking for." />
    <string enum="4933310" value="And it’s not the stupid medicine. I know they're here because I went AWOL. They never forgive." />
    <string enum="4933314" value="Anyway. It’s true that I’ve been taking the medical supplies. They are sitting right there in the shantytown. That will confuse the soldiers, at least at first." />

    <string enum="4559146" value="Welcome to Bowa-Seko. - Nice work, with Gakumba. The man deserved it." />
    <string enum="4559163" value="Listen. I’m taking a bit of initiative here. The big boss, Major Tambossa, doesn’t know anything about it, and I’d like to keep it that way. - You follow?" />
    <string enum="4559170" value="Because here’s the thing. The situation being what it is these days, there’s a good chance the warlords in the South could join forces. If that happens, guaranteed, blokes like you and I are out of a job. Or worse - shot and dumped overboard like some rotten meat." />
    <string enum="4559182" value="So. To keep that from happening, I’m going to stir the pot. - Turns out your friend the Jackal’s been hiding a massive weapons cache on his island. Lake Segolo. I’ve worked out a way to sail those weapons straight into the city - under a UFLL flag. Tambossa will assume the Front's to blame, and next thing you know, we’re back at it." />
    <string enum="4559190" value="I’ve got a skipper. All the bribes have been arranged. All I need now is a man to ride along, keep an eye on the merchandise." />
    <string enum="4559195" value="How bout it. You interested?" />
    <string enum="4559203" value="Good. Make your way to the island and rendezvous with the ferry. The skipper will handle the rest." />
    <string enum="4559212" value="We’ll be back fighting this idiotic war in no time. And then I'll get you a meeting with the Major." />
    <string enum="4559222" value="Look at this story on the television. These pictures of the children in our camps, dying of dysentery. It’s very sad. - You know, when people see these pictures, it will break their hearts. They will have to send money, to help." />
    <string enum="4559231" value="None of it will ever get to those poor sods." />
    <string enum="4559227" value="It will. Eventually. But it has to come to US first. We know how to handle it." />
    <string enum="4973218" value="Sure you do." />
    <string enum="4559239" value="If you’re looking for a job, we’ve got one." />
    <string enum="4559247" value="Good to meet you at last. I’ve heard a lot about you. We’d like to talk to you about a job." />

    <string enum="4559260" value="We’ve ascertained..." />

    <string enum="4559284" value="By blackmail. - That’s how. They grabbed a shipment of - something important... Fuel or something. But the country next door is desperate. Will pay anything." />
    <string enum="4972868" value="You see? Blackmail works!" />
    <string enum="4559291" value="The neighbors purchased some natural gas. It’s sitting on a train now stuck at the depot. The plan is to blow up the tank cars and queer the deal." />
    <string enum="4559296" value="Railyard’s about one and a half kilometers west of Pala, right on the edge of the desert." />
    <string enum="4559303" value="So I have this idea. You blow up the train. OK?" />
    <string enum="4559308" value="Uh yes… the railyard is about one and a half kilometers west of Pala, right on the edge of the desert." />
    <string enum="4559312" value="Easy! One move and BAM!" />
    <string enum="4559319" value="What we’d like you to do is go straight to the railyard and take out those natural gas cars." />
    <string enum="4559324" value="Now here’s the thing. Tankers are durable. Small-arms fire isn't going to cut it. You’ve got to get right in there and use explosives." />
    <string enum="4559331" value="You’re a professional, and you know damn well and good these cars are going to be fortified." />
    <string enum="4559336" value="I DON'T suggest hitting them long-range. You'll want to get in close and plant explosives." />
    <string enum="4559340" value="Then watch the big fire burn!" />
    <string enum="4559348" value="Once trains are gone, hey! - No more medicine." />
    <string enum="4973348" value="Too bad. So sad." />
    <string enum="4559357" value="It’s simple, really. Just go to the railyard and destroy those natural-gas cars." />
    <string enum="4559362" value="Payment for your trouble." />
    <string enum="4559370" value="Bye bye!" />

    <string enum="4559389" value="You know what the people are saying? They say that all of you are going to leave the country." />
    <string enum="4559394" value="Just a bunch of lies. Don’t believe everything you hear. You paid us to do a job, eh? We’re going to do it." />
    <string enum="4559398" value="The money brought Bastion to Africa. No more money, no more PMC." />
    <string enum="4559402" value="Well then keep the ducats coming, and you won’t have a problem." />
    <string enum="4559406" value="Yes, of course that is what matters. Not the work. Not the effort to build a stronger Africa." />
    <string enum="4559410" value="Oh. Is that what you’re doing? Didn’t realize. When you send your boys off to do your dirty work, even scores, and then hire mercs when the soldier supply runs low. You reckon that’s making things better, do ya." />
    <string enum="4559498" value="There’s a shed in there, between two greenhouses. It houses the irrigation pumps." />
    <string enum="4559503" value="I’d like you to take it out. You’re clever. You’ll know exactly what to do." />
    <string enum="4559418" value="What Dr. Gakumba is trying to tell you is that we’ve got a job, and we’re looking for a freelancer to take it. Somebody like you, china." />
    <string enum="4559426" value="Want a job, china? This one’s right up your alley. I’ve got a plan to hit the APR where they live." />
    <string enum="4559434" value="The APR’s providing security for some European agribusiness. You know the type. Blokes in three-piece suits, eager to try some funny business with the local ecosystem, and no complaints." />
    <string enum="4559439" value="So APR soldiers guard the farms, and in exchange, the company gives them all the rabbit food they can eat." />
    <string enum="4559446" value="Bloody fighters over there are eating like kings these days. You know why?" />
    <string enum="4559451" value="They’re getting paid by this agribusiness outfit. Bit of quid pro quo." />
    <string enum="4559455" value="APR guards the farms, and in exchange, the company gives them bushels of food." />
    <string enum="4559462" value="WE would like YOU to put a stop to this treachery. The company farm is in the foothills east of town." />
    <string enum="4559470" value="It’s immoral, what they’re doing there. contaminating the water, the land." />
    <string enum="4559475" value="Sure, whatever. Point is that the APR’s got an advantage over us." />
    <string enum="4559479" value="Now their soldiers are guarding the farm, east of town. In the middle is a set of greenhouses." />
    <string enum="4559490" value="There’s a shed in there, between two greenhouses. It houses the irrigation pumps. You figure out a way to destroy them." />
    <string enum="4559511" value="Then the scientists will understand that the APR cannot offer protection - to anybody. If you can do the job, that is." />
    <string enum="4559520" value="You get the gist, eh? Go to the greenhouse complex, find the shed with all the pipes, and take it out." />
    <string enum="4559525" value="Payments in stones, same as always." />
    <string enum="4559533" value="Perhaps we've offended the man." />
    <string enum="4559541" value="As you wish." />
    <string enum="4559552" value="Good people, you must take care! The enemy is everywhere! He is the snake in the tall grass, the crocodile in the mud! Do not wait! Strike the enemy as soon as you see him!" />
    <string enum="4559557" value="Good people, protect your country! The APR snakes have entered the Lake Road preserve, south of the Airport. Go there now, good people, and flush out these snakes! Take off their heads, remove their fangs, drain their poison! Show these APR snakes we will not be afraid!" />
    <string enum="4559561" value="This is Liberation Radio." />
    <string enum="4559565" value="We play this music now as an offering to you, good people! Let it into your heart! Be brave! Do what has to be done!" />

    <string enum="4559636" value="I guess we'll be working together again. Psych Ops today." />

    <string enum="4559652" value="Good. A professional. Just what we need." />
    <string enum="4559657" value="Good to see you again." />
    <string enum="4559664" value="The Major and I were just discussing what to do about the radio announcer." />
    <string enum="4559669" value="The propaganda machine in this country is quite impressive, really." />
    <string enum="4559673" value="It is all lies." />
    <string enum="4559677" value="Yes. Of course. - When it’s the UFLL broadcasting." />
    <string enum="4559684" value="Let’s discuss a bit of business. - You’ve heard the radio. It’s outrageous, the lies." />
    <string enum="4559689" value="I have a plan to shut down Liberation Radio. Once and for all." />
    <string enum="4559696" value="We’re going to shut the station down. We’ve learned that they broadcast from a mobile vehicle. - That’s how they’ve managed to avoid our soldiers until now." />
    <string enum="4559701" value="But at nine a.m. this morning, they parked their station over Weelegol village." />
    <string enum="4559708" value="They are very crafty, these announcers. They do not use a building to broadcast." />
    <string enum="4559713" value="They have a trailer. It is a radio station on the move! But today, we know where they are." />
    <string enum="4559717" value="They are hiding in the rocks overlooking Weelegol Village. It is deserted. Nobody there to witness events." />
    <string enum="4559724" value="I would like you to attack this radio trailer and silence their station." />
    <string enum="4559729" value="You’re just one man. I understand it will be difficult. But at least you will have the element of surprise." />
    <string enum="4559733" value="And it is a simple job. All you have to do is blow up one generator." />
    <string enum="4559740" value="They have selected a good position. If I send an entire squad, they would see my men coming. They would have time to escape, defend themselves." />
    <string enum="4559745" value="But you are just one man. You will have the element of surprise. And all you have to do is blow up one generator." />
    <string enum="4559749" value="A man as strong and as fast as you will have no problem." />
    <string enum="4559757" value="I hope you will consider our cause. The lies these men tell are helping no one." />
    <string enum="4559766" value="We’ve arranged payment, of course." />
    <string enum="4559771" value="Destroying the generator will cripple their transmitter. - Remember. You’re looking for Weelegol Village." />
    <string enum="4559779" value="This is no way to treat a man in my position." />
    <string enum="4559798" value="It’s risky." />
    <string enum="4559803" value="What is risky? It will not affect OUR people." />
    <string enum="4559807" value="You’re in no shape to start a war with another country." />
    <string enum="4559811" value="Who says there will be a war? Mr. Greaves, you are too literal. WE will not be responsible for this horrible travesty." />
    <string enum="4559815" value="No! Our prayers will go out to the unfortunate victims of this tragedy." />
    <string enum="4559819" value="This will UNITE us. One Africa. Now do you see? We need this right now. Too much unrest on the streets. This will FOCUS people on what is important." />
    <string enum="4559827" value="Hard to believe you’ve managed to survive this long." />
    <string enum="4559835" value="Hello." />
    <string enum="4559843" value="Ah. I remember you. Rather difficult to forget." />
    <string enum="4559851" value="This is the perfect man for this job." />
    <string enum="4559856" value="Knows how to keep his mouth shut." />
    <string enum="4559863" value="We need someone to rupture a pipeline." />
    <string enum="4559868" value="Not just any pipeline." />
    <string enum="4559872" value="No. Addi Mbantuwe's people are pumping water over the border, in exchange for large cash payments." />
    <string enum="4559876" value="The nerve of this man!" />
    <string enum="4559883" value="I hear you know how to work with explosives. We need a man to shut down a large pipeline." />
    <string enum="4559888" value="Mbantuwe is selling freshwater to our neighbors. The UFLL will not profit at the expense of our people." />
    <string enum="4559895" value="The pipeline’s being serviced at the moment, so it’s quite vulnerable." />
    <string enum="4559900" value="You’ll find your weak point at the construction site. About half a kilometer west of the pumping station on Lake Segolo." />
    <string enum="4559907" value="The pipeline is going to suffer a total and complete system failure. And soon." />
    <string enum="4559912" value="Of course we would never be involved in such a thing. It must be the work of a free agent." />
    <string enum="4559919" value="This pipe is huge. Will require large explosives." />
    <string enum="4559924" value="You’ll find suitable demolitions at the TaeMoCo mine." />
    <string enum="4559928" value="But the mine is in enemy territory, my friend. West of here. You’ll have to be very careful." />
    <string enum="4559935" value="The pipe is most vulnerable at the construction site. Maybe two-hundred meters inland from the lake." />
    <string enum="4559940" value="But first, you will travel to the TaeMo diamond mine and... liberate some TNT." />
    <string enum="4559944" value="The mine is in enemy territory. This will not be an easy mission." />
    <string enum="4559952" value="Greaves worries. He thinks of the people who rely on that water." />
    <string enum="4559957" value="But this is wartime. Suffering is unavoidable, eh? It is for the greater good. For a stronger Africa." />
    <string enum="4559965" value="The money’s in here. You’ll find the explosives at the diamond mine demo shed and the pipeline target at the construction site." />
    <string enum="4559970" value="Good luck." />
    <string enum="4559978" value="Greaves. I thought you said this was a friend." />
    <string enum="4559986" value="This one wants to work." />
    <string enum="4560002" value="…That’s what I’m trying to tell you. He didn’t SELL the weapons this time. He GAVE them away." />
    <string enum="4560010" value="That’s ridiculous. He’s an arms dealer. He has to sell the weapons to live." />
    <string enum="4560014" value="And now he’s gone. He’s up to something. I’m telling you." />
    <string enum="4560022" value="Enough. I want you to focus on the real problem at hand - the people! They are no longer listening to us. Defying our orders. THEY are the threat, Greaves. Not this Jackal person." />
    <string enum="4560030" value="Right. Good. We’ve been looking for someone like you." />
    <string enum="4560038" value="He’s a free agent. - no ties to us." />
    <string enum="4560046" value="Good to see you again. You’re just what we need. Important job today." />
    <string enum="4560054" value="You said you wanted a free agent for the job. That’s your man, right there. Best there is." />
    <string enum="4560062" value="There’s a serious morphine shortage in this country. The stuff just can’t be found." />
    <string enum="4560067" value="People get desperate when it’s time for surgery. They’ll use anything to dull the pain. Whisky. Aerosol fumes. Saw a man drink paint thinner, once." />
    <string enum="4560074" value="We are going to severely limit the supply of anesthetic in this country. We are tired of surgeries and miraculous recoveries." />
    <string enum="4560079" value="When we shoot our enemies, we want them to die in the street. Not recuperate in a hospital, with pretty nurses around." />
    <string enum="4560086" value="This shortage helps us, frankly. Less surgeries, less soldiers surviving. The UFLL has a small quantity of nitrous oxide. We’d like you to destroy it. The gas tanks are at an old dental clinic, west of Port Selao." />
    <string enum="4560094" value="There are several nitrous-oxide tanks stacked outside a former dental clinic, west of Mosate-Selao." />
    <string enum="4560099" value="They’re sitting on a flatbed truck, right in the street." />
    <string enum="4560103" value="You see? Sometimes, they make it too easy." />
    <string enum="4560110" value="The tanks are stacked high as your chest on a flatbed truck. They’re right out there for everyone to see." />
    <string enum="4560115" value="A stationary target, one that won’t fight back. Think you can handle that?" />
    <string enum="4560122" value="You can destroy these tanks any way you see fit. Use your imagination. Just make sure they are ALL destroyed." />
    <string enum="4560127" value="We will see how smoothly their surgeries go when the patients are still awake. Eh?" />
    <string enum="4560135" value="Mr. Greaves here has learned to accept the nature of our work! You must always look for the advantage!" />
    <string enum="4560140" value="So?" />
    <string enum="4560148" value="We’ll pay in stones, same as always. Just so we’re clear: Go to the dental clinic and take out those nitrous tanks." />
    <string enum="4560153" value="Are we good?" />
    <string enum="4560161" value="Where is he going?" />
    <string enum="4560169" value="Big man. Does what he wants." />
    <string enum="4560193" value="This is the worst idea I’ve heard in a long time." />
    <string enum="4560180" value="I assure you, Greaves. I have thought this through. It’s for the best." />
    <string enum="4560185" value="Easy for you to say. You’re sitting in the first seat. - Now I’m warning you: don’t even THINK about shutting me out. I’ve done too much for this outfit." />
    <string enum="4560197" value="Thank you for the advice." />
    <string enum="4560214" value="Come in, my friend. I have excellent news." />
    <string enum="4560231" value="I hear you have been working for the UFLL! - It’s all right, come in, we are all friends here." />
    <string enum="4560243" value="I’ve been in contact with Mbantuwe. We have decided that it’s time to bring an end to this conflict. The people are troubled. Too much unrest. It has to end." />
    <string enum="4560255" value="Here. I want you to take this to Mbantuwe. He is at the Seko Brewery. Tell him I accept his terms. - Go on. Take it." />
    <string enum="4560267" value="In exchange, he will give you a diamond attaché case. Bring it here, and then we will know that we have a good-faith arrangement." />
    <string enum="4560205" value="No. No, no, no, no..." />
    <string enum="4560284" value="Best watch your back, &quot;mate&quot;. Times are changing." />
    <string enum="4560293" value="See him out." />
    <string enum="4560303" value="The boat’s lined up. Everything’s set. I just need a man to ferry it through." />
    <string enum="4560312" value="Two hours. Tops." />
    <string enum="4560316" value="No. Not him. I need a man who can keep his bloody mouth shut." />
    <string enum="4560341" value="Never mind. I think I just solved my problem." />
    <string enum="4560333" value="Good! You made it. - And Kouassi’s dead. - So now the question is, what’s our next move." />
    <string enum="4560354" value="Did you hear? Bastion UK packed up and left the country. - That’s right. I spent ten years leading most of those boys in Angola, and look how they repay me." />
    <string enum="4560349" value="- We’re on our own. Only way any of us are going to make it is if we plan ahead." />
    <string enum="4560365" value="I’ve been thinking about it. There’s a good chance the warlords in Bowa-Seko will decide to join forces. End the conflict for a while. If that happens, soldiers like you and I are fucked." />
    <string enum="4560370" value="The men in charge always manage to get by." />
    <string enum="4560374" value="It’s the foot-soldiers that get lined up against the wall and shot. Every time." />
    <string enum="4560381" value="So! We’re going to keep that from happening. Turns out your friend the Jackal’s got a huge stockpile of weapons hidden on an island near Port Selao." />
    <string enum="4560386" value="We’re going to bring them into the city. Give them to all the locals. And under an APR flag, too. I reckon that’ll force my boss to get his head back in the game." />
    <string enum="4560393" value="Let’s get things started up again. Let’s face it: we need the business." />
    <string enum="4560398" value="I’ve got a captain to handle the boat. Now I just need someone I can trust to escort the goods." />
    <string enum="4560402" value="How about it. You interested? I can get you a meeting the big man. Addi Mbantuwe." />
    <string enum="4560575" value="Could be the best thing, really. I mean the hell with Bastion." />
    <string enum="4560580" value="Too bad to be left behind like that." />
    <string enum="4560584" value="Nobody asked you. There are still plenty of men in-country. They’ll work with me for sure. They need the money." />
    <string enum="4560588" value="They’ll work for ME, you mean." />
    <string enum="4560592" value="As long as you pay, Addi. God knows you’ve got the work." />
    <string enum="4560596" value="That’s right. These civilians are a problem. We’re going to get them under control. I don’t like the way things are going. It’s no longer safe." />
    <string enum="4560672" value="Yes. They’re using kilns to dry out the plant, turn it into medicine powder. These kilns are way up in the Dogon village." />
    <string enum="4560677" value="You know it, I reckon. Maybe you already killed a few men there." />
    <string enum="4560684" value="We’d like YOU to smash these kilns into bits." />
    <string enum="4560689" value="Then OK, nobody gets medicine." />
    <string enum="4560696" value="We would like you to find a way up into the village and destroy the kilns. All of them." />
    <string enum="4560701" value="Burn the rest." />
    <string enum="4560604" value="You still sick? Not going to waste my time on a sick man." />
    <string enum="4560612" value="He looks healthy enough. Reckon he’ll do." />
    <string enum="4560620" value="Long time." />
    <string enum="4560628" value="Ho. - How's it? You ready for a job or what?" />
    <string enum="4560636" value="Malaria situation’s out of control. Turns out that the APR’s got a lock on some sort of remedy." />
    <string enum="4560641" value="A plant that grows here. Artemisia. A very potent plant. Our medicine men know exactly how to use it." />
    <string enum="4560648" value="The APR has got an advantage over us. They have found a way to use this herb, the Artemisia plant, to help their soldiers who are suffering from malaria. We would like to take away their advantage." />
    <string enum="4560653" value="Everybody’s getting sick these days. It’s a bloody plague." />
    <string enum="4560660" value="Ya. Anyway as I was saying, the APR’s got a system for drying out the plant, turning it into medicine." />
    <string enum="4560665" value="They’ve got these kilns, see. Up in the Dogon cliff-village." />
    <string enum="4560709" value="This is Tambossa’s fault. He is to blame, with his selfishness and favoritism. If the APR want to know where their medicine has gone, they need only look at their leader!" />
    <string enum="4560739" value="Busy man, I see." />
    <string enum="4560718" value="Stones. Uncut." />
    <string enum="4560723" value="Just so we're clear: Go to the Dogon cliff-dwellings and destroy the kilns." />
    <string enum="4560759" value="You should talk to Bastion. Tell them to come back." />
    <string enum="4560755" value="They won’t. Look what they did to ME. Left me high and dry." />
    <string enum="4560767" value="We are in a dangerous situation. You walk in the streets, you can feel that something could happen with the civilians at any moment. They dare to show me anger. Defy my orders. I do not know what’s come over them." />
    <string enum="4560763" value="The Jackal’s come over them, that’s what. I’m telling you. He’s up to something." />
    <string enum="4560750" value="Enough of that. I don’t want to hear that man’s name again." />
    <string enum="4560779" value="Come on. We’ve got work. - Going after an arms dealer today." />
    <string enum="4560784" value="Bit of a specialty of yours, as I recall." />
    <string enum="4560791" value="You look like you could use a bit of wonga, china. - We’re going after an arms dealer today." />
    <string enum="4560796" value="Bit of a specialty of yours, as I recall." />
    <string enum="4560803" value="He lives! - Been a while. Hope you feel up to a challenge. Right up your alley. We’ve got an arms dealer who’s been giving us problems." />
    <string enum="4560811" value="I’ve been hearing your name. Seems you know how to get things done." />
    <string enum="4560816" value="I could use your specific expertise today. Target’s a tough one. Arms dealer." />
    <string enum="4560823" value="The APR’s got a lock the on black market. Some gun runners selling only to them." />
    <string enum="4560828" value="No good. Our boys need guns too." />
    <string enum="4560839" value="So. Strong man. You can send a message to the man who runs the black market." />
    <string enum="4560844" value="He has the wrong idea. Thinks the APR is a good bet. Now he’s working just for them." />
    <string enum="4560848" value="How do you think I plan to deal with such a man? Make everyone around him understand his mistake." />

    <string enum="4577361" value="You’re fired. You know it, and so do I. You had your shot, but now it’s over. - And since men like you only work for money, you’re no longer my problem." />

    <string enum="4577437" value="You’ve seen the fighting. The war is getting worse by the minute. - It’s absurd. Because why are they fighting? For what? You can see, the country is destroyed. The people, the diamonds, the cities -" />
    <string enum="4577442" value="But the battle rages on. With the Jackal’s weapons, no less. It’s going to end badly.  And I’m afraid I will be here to see it. I’m a bit of a rubbernecker, I suppose." />

    <string enum="4577606" value="It’s a goddamn disease is what it is. It’s a cancer. - You see it. They can’t get enough. They just TAKE and TAKE until it kills them. And once they’re gone, someone else takes their place, and they’re diseased, too. Every cell is infected." />

    <string enum="CuSyn_AA" value="Five minutes in this country and it's clear - things are about to go very bad. The UFLL and the APR are gearing up for open fighting. My mission is simple - to kill 'The Jackal' - the bastard that armed both sides." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_00" value="I'm sick. Malaria. Somehow the Jackal managed to track me down to my hotel… not sure why he didn't kill me… probably thought I wouldn't survive another day… And I nearly didn't… Bottom line, I couldn't stay in that town…." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_01" value="Total anarchy. After escaping Pala, I was put to work by FIRST_LT a local FIRST_LT_FACTION lieutenant. After busting my new buddy out of captivity, I met a journalist named Reuben who helped me get some malaria medicine from Father Maliya and the Underground." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_04" value="In the end, I couldn't trust SECOND_LT_FACTION_BOSS or the SECOND_LT_FACTION. I went back to work for FIRST_LT_FACTION_BOSS and the FIRST_LT_FACTION. Turned out they paid better. Naturally I haven't been winning too many points with FIRST_LT." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_02" value="Considering that I almost died in Pala, I sure didn't waste any time heading back there. FIRST_LT of the FIRST_LT_FACTION introduced me to his boss FIRST_LT_FACTION_BOSS. The big man's promised me information about the Jackal in exchange for doing some jobs for him." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_07" value="Once I'd killed WINNING_FACTION_BOSS, my work in Leboa-Sako was done. LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 was willing to let bygones be bygones after my false-flag operation with ASSIGNED_A2SM06 put the fear back into LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD and The Jackal's guns back on the streets of Port Selao." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_10" value="Playing both sides against the middle has been dangerous. I always knew one side or the other would make their push if they thought they could pull it off. I hoped that working with MISSION_BUDDY_A2SM08 could keep me from being double-crossed like last time." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_05" value="After working for both the WINNING_FACTION_A1 and the LOSING_FACTION_A1, it started to look like WINNING_FACTION_A1 was going to come out ahead in Leboa-Sako. I couldn't really trust WINNING_FACTION_BOSS, but he had promised me information about the Jackal…" />
    <string enum="CuSyn_06" value="WINNING_FACTION_BOSS betrayed me… but he didn't finish the job. The Jackal found me in the desert… taking off once LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 showed up. He was desperate enough to send me to kill WINNING_FACTION_BOSS while the LOSING_FACTION_A1 tried to regroup. I would've done it anyway." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_12" value="Playing the factions in Bowa-Seko turned out to be just as dangerous as it was up north. The difference was that LOSING_FACTION_WARLORD's murder put all their futures in limbo. Me killing WINNING_FACTION_WARLORD on LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A2's orders only kept them there… for a while anyway." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_03" value="It turned out FIRST_LT had an enemy named SECOND_LT who got me a meeting with SECOND_LT_FACTION big-wig SECOND_LT_FACTION_BOSS. I was hoping he'd be a more useful source of info than FIRST_LT_FACTION_BOSS." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_13" value="After weeks of killing each other off, the factions started eating their own. First, FIRST_LT decided he could fill the vacuum left by the death of FIRST_LT_WARLORD as well as anyone. Then his pal SECOND_LT decided to emulate. In the end, I decided who got to play warlord and who just got dead." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_08" value="After I strengthened his position, LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 took me under his wing. He introduced me to the LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD - head of the LOSING_FACTION_A1. I figured that if anyone could help me find the Jackal, it would be him." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_09" value="LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 wasn't the only one to make it out of Leboa-Sako in one piece. Seems like WINNING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 got promoted to be WINNING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD's right-hand-man after I killed WINNING_FACTION_BOSS. I learned that by pulling some gigs with WINNING_FACTION_A1." />
    <string enum="CuSyn_11" value="After what happened up north, LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 warned me that the factions might join forces to get rid of all the &quot;troublemakers&quot;… MISSION_BUDDY_A2SM08 arranged an evac, and I tried to get the diamonds to pay for it. But the Jackal set me up to take the fall for LOSING_FACTION_WARLORD's death…" />
    <string enum="ChSyn_01" value="I ended up in the custody of FIRST_LT. Guy's middle-management in the FIRST_LT_FACTION. He sent me into a SECOND_LT_FACTION garrison where I busted out a foreigner named PRIMARY_BUDDY_NAME. We met up again later at a bar called Mike's, where I got a source for malaria meds from a reporter named Reuben." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_02" value="With my symptoms stabilized, I took FIRST_LT up on his offer. Figured his boss might have a line on The Jackal. FIRST_LT_FACTION_BOSS clearly likes having a &quot;deniable asset&quot; he can use in his feud with SECOND_LT_FACTION_BOSS. Seems like neither of these clowns wants to risk all-out war." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_06" value="I should have been smart. Instead I was just lucky. Lucky to be left for dead. Lucky that the Jackal found me in the desert. Lucky that LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 and LOSING_FACTION_A1 ran out of options and decided I was more useful as an assassin than a corpse. But killing WINNING_FACTION_BOSS had nothing to do with luck…" />
    <string enum="ChSyn_03" value="I decided that putting all my chips on FIRST_LT_FACTION wasn't a good play. I went down the street and pulled three jobs in a row for SECOND_LT_FACTION. Risky, but SECOND_LT_FACTION_BOSS was willing to pay for my loyalty. Now that I've got some heat, we'll see if I can trade on it for the information I need." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_07" value="When I turned up in Sefapane, LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 decided I was his secret weapon. He sent me with some expat named ASSIGNED_A2SM06 to haul a boat-load of guns into the cease-fire zone… Just to trick his own boss LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD into taking a harder line with WINNING_FACTION_A1 in Bowa-Seko." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_04" value="I tried to keep the factions off-balance… let SECOND_LT_FACTION_BOSS know that I had options. I talked my way back into FIRST_LT_FACTION headquarters and into more work. FIRST_LT_FACTION_BOSS was clearly not happy about it, but I don't think I left him any choice. Things have escalated." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_09" value="It didn't take LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD and LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 long to start giving me the runaround… So I paid a visit to WINNING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD. We reached an understanding, and started bringing some pain on behalf of WINNING_FACTION_A1." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_12" value="I managed to bust out of that prison. I still owe MISSION_BUDDY_A2SM09 for that. But at the time, the only one looking to collect was LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A2, who was scrambling to hold the LOSING_FACTION_A2 together. He needed a level playing field, and that meant WINNING_FACTION_WARLORD had to go." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A2LM11base" value="My latest assignment from the UFLL - To kill a Jordanian weapons dealer named Yabek. He was operated from a barge parked along the Noga River, and offering his goods exclusively to the APR." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A2SM06" value="My first gig for LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1 after making it down to Bowa-Seko - To rendezvous with ASSIGNED_A2SM06, the ferry captain, and bring a boat-load of the Jackal's guns into Port Selao under a WINNING_FACTION_A1 flag. All this just to convince LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD that he can't trust WINNING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD or the WINNING_FACTION_A1 to honor their cease-fire in the south…" />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A1LM06subv" value="MISSION_BUDDY_A1LM06 told me that the King's son Oeduard wants to take over the family's fortunes back in Europe, and proposed a plan where I kill the King and take his signet." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A1LM05subv" value="MISSION_BUDDY_A1LM05 told me where to find an old canister of military-grade defoliant and offered to spray down the farm with OGC's own crop-dusting plane." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A3SM11" value="With LOSING_FACTION_WARLORD's murder, LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A2 put LOSING_FACTION_A2 on high alert and fell back to his CP in Sefapane. He knew that if it came to shooting war, WINNING_FACTION_A2 would be in the stronger position. He decided to take the direct route to resetting the balance, and sent me to kill WINNING_FACTION_WARLORD." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A2LM08subv" value="MISSION_BUDDY_A2LM08 told me about the safety systems in the pumphouse that automatically shut off the pumps if there's a breach. If I sabotaged those systems first, the pipeline bomb would start a flood…" />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A2LM10subv" value="MISSION_BUDDY_A2LM10 told me where to find some APR teamster who was involved in transporting the processed powder to some hidden stockpile." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A2SM09" value="After murdering LOSING_FACTION_WARLORD, the Jackal threw me to the wolves - no pun intended. I ended up in a garden-variety African prison hell-hole, with MISSION_BUDDY_A2SM09 in the cell next door. Escaping in one piece became priority one…" />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A2LM12base" value="My latest assignment from the UFLL - To eliminate Seth Uniya, a former shop teacher who'd been teaching bomb-making 101 to the APR." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A2LM12subv" value="MISSION_BUDDY_A2LM12 told me about Uniya's side business: Diverting relief air-drops. He used the local cel towers as nav beacons for his pilot accomplice, and there was a way to put that system to our own use." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A3SM15" value="Based on Reuben's intel, I tracked down the Jackal to the same jungle prison that I had escaped from. He had cleared the place out and was using it as a way-station for evacuating all of the remaining civilians over the border. His plan was batshit crazy, but it wasn't without its merits. Like the part where he wanted me to eliminate WINNING_HCLEAN_APR and WINNING_HCLEAN_UFLL to keep their men from interfering…" />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A2SM08" value="My latest assignment for WINNING_FACTION_A2 - To courier a message from WINNING_FACTION_WARLORD to LOSING_FACTION_WARLORD ratifying some kind of peace deal… Even WINNING_FACTION_HELPER_A2 acted skeptical, but MISSION_BUDDY_A2SM08 was convinced that the deal would spell disaster for us. Most of the independent contractors want to evacuate, and I was asked to secure the diamonds to pay for it." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A3SM13" value="After FIRST_LT_FACTION found its leadership reduced to one guy, I got a call from Reuben asking me to meet him at the Marina. He was there - but he wasn't alone. SECOND_LT was there too, having arrived in the aftermath of his boss's killing. He wanted me to replicate my heavy-handed approach to career advancement to his own situation at SECOND_LT_FACTION." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A3SM16" value="WINNING_HCLEAN_APR and WINNING_HCLEAN_UFLL were dead. So were PRIMARY_BUDDY_NAME and SECONDARY_BUDDY_NAME. All at my hand. The only question afterwards was, would I be able to walk out of that jungle alive and live with it?" />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A3SM12" value="While the dust settled from the latest crisis, I paid a visit to FIRST_LT_FACTION's HQ in the Port and was surprised to find FIRST_LT alive and well and sitting his late boss's chair. With his former colleague holding the reigns, he was feeling shut out of the big decisions… and decided a shake-up in the front office was in order." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A3SM14" value="While I was still up to my ankles in SECOND_LT_FACTION blood, I got another call from Reuben, this time from the airport where he and a bunch of other foreigners were being detained. The situation was getting worse, and there was no better indicator of that than the fact that UFLL and APR troops were working together…" />

    <string enum="ChSyn_AA" value="It wasn't so long ago that this was another one of those dirty little wars that barely rated a sidebar. There was an arms embargo in place, and everyone back home could just cluck their tongues and plan their next tax-deductible donation…" />
    <string enum="MiSyn_AA" value="When The Jackal showed up here with containers full of AKs and RPGs - That set off some alarm bells somewhere. This guy really puts the fear in the black-bag crowd. There must be some history there they can't afford to have walking around…" />

    <string enum="ChSyn_05" value="I was too effective. WINNING_FACTION_BOSS started getting ideas. He sent me to Goka Falls to eliminate LOSING_FACTION_BOSS, and then tried to kill me when the job was done. All part of a larger offensive across Leboa-Sako. In the end, I tried to mount a defense at DEFREV_LOCN. Tried and failed." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_08" value="The gambit paid off for LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_A1. Tensions between the factions mounted, and suddenly my services were in demand again. He introduced me to LOSING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD at LOSING_FACTION_A1 HQ in Port Selao. The stakes may be higher now, but it's the same drill. I'm back to pulling jobs off-the-books." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_11" value="After everything I did to keep the conflict alive, the one thing I never saw coming was a treaty between the factions. It's not like Mbantuwe and Tambossa were stumping for a Peace Prize. They were trying to keep off the heat from their own people. They wanted a scapegoat. And thanks to the Jackal, they got one." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_14" value="While we'd been busy with the purges, the Jackal made his final play. A mass evacuation of civilians over the border. I learned the story from Reuben and knew that my assignment was almost done. Eliminating WINNING_HCLEAN_APR and WINNING_HCLEAN_UFLL finished the factions. PRIMARY_BUDDY_NAME and SECONDARY_BUDDY_NAME decided they couldn't forgive me and they paid for it with their lives." />
    <string enum="ChSyn_10" value="I knew it wouldn't last. Three high-risk operations later and I'd gotten just about all I was going to from WINNING_FACTION_HELPER_WARLORD and WINNING_FACTION_HELPER_A1.

    <string enum="ChSyn_13" value="While Voorhees and Greaves tried to figure out how to be warlords, their former comrades from Leboa-Sako were showing their stripes. FIRST_LT saw no reason why he shouldn't run FIRST_LT_FACTION and recruited me to arrange his &quot;promotion&quot;… SECOND_LT recognized a sound strategy when he saw one and followed suit." />
    <string enum="MiSyn_A1LM02subv" value="MISSION_BUDDY_A1LM02 told me that some mid-level functionary has been renting out UFLL troops on the side and outlined a plan to eliminate this man in order to get those troops back into play." />

    <string enum="MiSyn_A1LM04subv" value="MISSION_BUDDY_A1LM04 told me that these commandos had an informant inside the APR that was feeding them intel, and explained a way to use this guy to spoof their op codes and send them into an ambush." />
